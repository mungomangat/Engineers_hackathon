# Engineers_hackathon

The bulk of our project is created within PowerApps. The link to this is attached below. Please allow location and camera to be used by the app. If access to Custom Vision is denied, select ignore.



The app allow users to take and upload images to Custom Vision. This is a trained machine learning model which has the ability to classify animal species and add this as a tag to the meta-data of the image. The species of the animal and the time and location associated with the photo are then uploaded to a SQL table in Azure storage. Unfortunately, access to Custom Vision and Azure is private and can only be run from the computer logged into these services. This functionality will be demonstrated in the live presentation.
